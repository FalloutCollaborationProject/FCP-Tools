        <description>Crystal Sparkle was born in pre-war China and immigrated to America with dreams of becoming a doctor. She was studying medicine and performing as an amateur magician when the Great War began, and the bombs turned her world to ash.

Despite her ghoulified state, Crystal dedicated herself to helping others in the wasteland, using her medical knowledge and sleight-of-hand tricks to bring hope and wonder to those in need. She met Ranger Rick after patching him up from a deadly ambush, and the two have been inseparable ever since.

        <description>Growing up, [PAWN_nameDef] was always taking chances—whether it was sneaking into forbidden ruins, betting bottle caps on two-headed ant races, or trading scavenged goods for a shot at something better. [PAWN_pronoun] learned early that luck could be as valuable as skill, and [PAWN_pronoun] was quick to make friends (and the occasional enemy) wherever [PAWN_pronoun] roamed. Every close call was just another story to tell around the campfire.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] worked as a courier for the Mojave Express, or a similar delivery company. To overcome the many dangers of the postapocalyptic wasteland, couriers had to be resilient individuals, capable of putting up a fight against raiders. Furthermore, [PAWN_nameDef] had a set of other survival skills, owed to the fact that [PAWN_pronoun] often lived alone on the road for many weeks.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was part of the comparatively young but rapidly growing cult called “The Children of Atom”. This cult worshipped a deity named Atom, and revered radiation and nuclear annihilation as manifestations of their god’s will. They believed, that within every atomic mass in all of creation existed an entire universe and nuclear fission was a divine act of creating new life. [PAWN_nameDef] became part of this cult while [PAWN_pronoun] was searching for meaning in the brutal, unforgiving world that came to be after the great war. Unfortunately for [PAWN_objective] not all wastelanders looked favourably upon such… innovative ideas.</description>

        <description>Since clean water was precious in most parts of the wasteland, water purifiers often decided over the live and death of a settlement. Due to [PAWN_possessive] moderate understanding of this incredibly important machine, [PAWN_nameDef] was assigned to look after it. To do that properly [PAWN_pronoun] often had to improvise while repairing the water purifier, as the old machine was prone to malfunctions and spare parts were rare.</description>

        <description>Usually only the larger settlements were hooked up to a power network, the smaller ones had to help themselves, if they wanted electricity. Pre-war solar arrays were a preferred choice, as they usually generated enough power for a small settlement and were comparatively easy to maintain and repair due to their rugged design. [PAWN_nameDef] was in charge of [PAWN_possessive] settlement’s solar arrays, a job [PAWN_pronoun] took very seriously.</description>

        <description>As a child, [PAWN_nameDef] once found pre-war magazines about the greaser culture and old holodisks with rock music. This proved to be quite the formative experience, as [PAWN_pronoun] never left this phase behind and continued to live [PAWN_possessive] life the greaser way. Keep it cool, Daddy-O!</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] grew up in a settlement where only children lived. The other kids looked up to [PAWN_objective], both figurately and literally, as [PAWN_pronoun] was one of the oldest children. Therefore, it was [PAWN_possessive] duty to ensure the safety of the town’s inhabitants.  After [PAWN_pronoun] reached a certain age [PAWN_pronoun] had to, like it was custom, leave the town and make a living someplace else.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was born in the city of Primm, a settlement south of New Vegas. While the town did have casinos of its own, it never managed to reach the glamour of the New Vegas strip. Still, the occasional caravan and gambler on the way to the strip ensured the town’s moderate wealth.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was born on the very frontier of human civilisation, such as it is. Thanks to its remoteness, the region was relatively free of radiation and the absence of larger settlements or trade routes made it unpopular for raiders. However, this also meant that everything had to be built from scratch, since there were little to no ruins to scavenge.</description>
