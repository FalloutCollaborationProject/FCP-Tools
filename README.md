## Requirements

| Dependency | Required |
|------------|----------|
| RimWorld 1.6 | Yes      |
| Harmony | Yes      |
| All DLC* | Yes      |

*\*Biotech is heavily utilized throughout the mod. Royalty features are also used. We will not hold back from using other DLC features where needed.*

## Installation

### Recommended: FCP Mod Updater
Use the official updater tool to easily install and keep FCP-Tools up to date:

**[FCP Mod Updater](https://github.com/FalloutCollaborationProject/FCP-Mod-Updater)**

### Alternative (Manual Updates) Zip Files:
1. Download and extract to your RimWorld `Mods` folder
   - Click code -> download as zip file
   - This is located in your game install, for steam you can right click RimWorld -> manage -> browse local files
   - Extract so that your folders look like RimWorld/Mods/FCP-Tools-Main and FCP-Tools-Main has the About Folder
2. Download [FCP-UnityAssets](https://github.com/FalloutCollaborationProject/FCP-UnityAssets) separately and extract it into the `FCP-UnityAssets` folder inside the mod directory. The FCP Mod Updater does this automatically, but manual zip downloads do not include submodule contents.
3. Enable in the mod manager
4. Load after Harmony, and Core DLCs, but high up.

### Alternative: Git
```bash
#to install
cd /path/to/RimWorld/Mods
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/FalloutCollaborationProject/FCP-Tools.git
```
```bash
#to update
git pull
```
