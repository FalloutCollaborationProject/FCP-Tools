        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was part of the elite fighting force that joined the NCR, the Desert Rangers. [PAWN_pronoun] excels in ranged combat and has quite a few other survival skills, owed to years of service in and around the wasteland. [PAWN_nameDef] hasn't always made the smartest choices, but always seems to talk [PAWN_possessive] way out of trouble. With a revolver and a smolder [PAWN_nameDef] wanders the wastes looking for the next settlement to help, and accidently bring into harms way...</description>

        <description>Crystal Sparkle was born in pre-war China and immigrated to America with dreams of becoming a doctor. She was studying medicine and performing as an amateur magician when the Great War began, and the bombs turned her world to ash. Exposed to extreme radiation, she became a glowing one, her body forever changed but her mind intact. Despite her ghoulified state, Crystal dedicated herself to helping others in the wasteland, using her medical knowledge and sleight-of-hand tricks to bring hope and wonder to those in need. She met Ranger Rick after patching him up from a deadly ambush, and the two have been inseparable ever since. Her glowing aura is both a beacon of hope and a danger in the unforgiving wasteland.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] worked as a courier for the Mojave Express, or a similar delivery company. To overcome the many dangers of the postapocalyptic wasteland, couriers had to be resilient individuals, capable of putting up a fight against raiders. Furthermore, [PAWN_nameDef] had a set of other survival skills, owed to the fact that [PAWN_pronoun] often lived alone on the road for many weeks.</description>

        <description>Regardless of the many larger and well-known political entities and groups which thrived throughout the wasteland, the majority of the humans living in post-war America were part of smaller, more or less independent settlements and groups.

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was part of the comparatively young but rapidly PlantWork cult called “The Children of Atom”. This cult worshipped a deity named Atom, and revered radiation and nuclear annihilation as manifestations of their god’s will. They believed, that within every atomic mass in all of creation existed an entire universe and nuclear fission was a divine act of creating new life. [PAWN_nameDef] became part of this cult while [PAWN_pronoun] was searching for meaning in the brutal, unforgiving world that came to be after the great war. Unfortunately for [PAWN_objective] not all wastelanders looked favourably upon such… innovative ideas.</description>

        <description>Life in the wasteland was often brutal, arduous and short. Some of the larger settlements employed an undertaker. [PAWN_nameDef] was one of those undertakers and [PAWN_possessive] job was to dig graves and bury those whose lives were claimed by raiders, radiation, mutated beasts and, occasionally, old age.</description>

        <description>Since clean water was precious in most parts of the wasteland, water purifiers often decided over the live and death of a settlement. Due to [PAWN_possessive] moderate understanding of this incredibly important machine, [PAWN_nameDef] was assigned to look after it. To do that properly [PAWN_pronoun] often had to improvise while repairing the water purifier, as the old machine was prone to malfunctions and spare parts were rare.</description>

        <description>The strict and military lifestyle of the Brotherhood wasn’t for everyone. While [PAWN_nameDef] was born into the Brotherhood of Steel, it didn’t take [PAWN_objective] long to realise that this kind of life just wasn’t for [PAWN_objective]. One night, while on guard duty, [PAWN_pronoun] left [PAWN_possessive] post to never return. [PAWN_nameDef] had some troubles adapting to a “civilian” life, but [PAWN_pronoun] had to keep a low profile and hope that [PAWN_possessive] former brothers and sisters wouldn’t catch [PAWN_objective]. Desertion wasn’t taken lightly by the Brotherhood of Steel.</description>

        <description>While playing in the wastes as a child, [PAWN_nameDef] was attacked and stung by a radscorpion. While [PAWN_pronoun] managed to survive both the attack itself and the poison injected into [PAWN_objective], [PAWN_pronoun] remained weakened for a long time. At least [PAWN_pronoun] learned a lot about animals and medicine during this painful experience.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was raised by a devoted cult. The cult aimed to form the largely barren wasteland into a paradise of green splendour. To further this goal all cultists were experts in tending to plants and animals. However, the cult was far from pacifistic, as the green patches the members cared for attracted a great number of scavengers, bot humans and beasts. Thus, [PAWN_nameDef] learned both gardening and herding as weel as fighting when [PAWN_pronoun] was young.</description>

        <description>Prostitution proved to be not only one of the oldest businesses of humanity, but also one of the most resilient. The practice survived the apocalypse and thrived in the wasteland. [PAWN_nameDef] was born in the surroundings of a brothel. While this upbringing might have been dubious in nature, it was also relatively safe, as brothels and whorehouses were usually well guarded and defended. [PAWN_pronoun] learned a lot about human nature and their interactions with each other while observing the clients.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was born and raised in Novac, one of the smaller settlements of the Mojave wasteland. While Novac did not have the mighty walls of New Vegas, nor the raw military power of the NCR to count on, its watchful citizens still made it one of the safer places to live. Plus, there were dinosaur souvenirs.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was born as the child of a wasteland mercenary. While [PAWN_possessive] parent trade ensured [PAWN_nameDef] rarely had to go hungry for an extended period of time, [PAWN_pronoun] was well aware that the dangers of the merc life could very well leave [PAWN_objective] orphaned. Despite this, [PAWN_nameDef] took after [PAWN_possessive] parent and started to fire, clean, and modify all the guns [PAWN_pronoun] could get [PAWN_possessive] hands on.</description>
